PI(D) output correction using Tiny NN

Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (PMSMs) are highly efficient and reliablebrushless motors, making them ideal for high-performance applications like industrial robots and machine tools. Despite their advantages, PMSM control remains a challenging area of research, particularly during abrupt speed transitions. Traditional Filed oriented control (PID-based) methods for plant linearization have shown limited success, and while Non-Linear Model Predictive Control (NLMPC) is theoretically optimal, its complexity makes on-device implementation impractical. This research focuses on improving PMSM control by integrating a neural network with a PI(D) controller to enhance speed tracking performance. The neural network corrects the reference quadrature current, mitigating overshoots and undershoots during speed transitions. After training, the model is optimized for deployment using the STM32AI developer cloud, ensuring it is suitable for real-time application with minimal computational overhead. Future work will explore replacing the dual PI(D) controllers with a single neural network to directly output reference voltages, further advancing PMSM control strategies.
